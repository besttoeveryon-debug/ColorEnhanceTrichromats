**"Enhancing Color Image for Anomalous Trichromats: A Deep Learning Approach with Detail Preservation"**

> **Abstract:** This study introduces a deep-learning-based method that simultaneously achieves contrast enhancement, naturalness preservation, and fine-grained detail preservation for anomalous trichromats. By constructing a dataset validated by color-deficient observers and employing a modified Pix2Pix GAN model with Swin Transformer and NonLocalBlock modules, our approach demonstrates superior performance.
